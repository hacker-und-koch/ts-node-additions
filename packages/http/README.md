# @hacker-und-koch/http

## Idea
This module is heavily based on [`@hacker-und-koch/di`](../di). It is meant for rapid prototyping and iterative encapsulation of concerns. The underlying dependency injection makes sharing database adapter instances simple and configuration of different environments rather painless.
